by default, "Handle display brightness keys" seem to be false/off.
initially, brightness keys are active
also, the "Brightness step count" and "Exponential" options are active

however, if we then toggle it to true/on and then back to false/off,
the brightness keys are then ignored
also, the "Brightness step count" and "Exponential" options are disabled/blocked
