when the laptop is suspended, the screen is locked
when the laptop is resumed, the lock screen is offset in the vertical direction by maybe 10 pixels

the top bar is only shown a little bit
there is a black bar at the bottom part
the mouse pointer stays on the screen at all times, and it doesn't show any problems
which means that this is not a video output issue
