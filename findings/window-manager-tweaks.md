the last tab "Compositor" contents is much longer than the other tabs

there is very little hint about this fact, other than the scrollbar that does not appear
until there is a mouse pointer over the scrollable area

user story: i want to see what options there are, so that i can customize my desktop

possible solutions include splitting the content into a new tab, or rearranging the content
so that it won't be too much longer than the other tabs
