if the accessibility menu is clicked, then Large Text is clicked, text becomes large

however, the accessibility menu becomes inaccessible:
- the menu size stays the same
- the contents (text) becomes very big
- the menu gets up-scroll and down-scroll buttons

this makes it very hard to select a menu item (for example to cancel the large text effect)


when shutting down, the confirmation dialog is very small
