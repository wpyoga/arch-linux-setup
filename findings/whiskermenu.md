when the shortcut key is pressed, it immediately appears

so if the shortcut key is the windows button, the whisker menu immediately appears
that means if we want to launch the file manager using the default shortcut (windows + E)
then the whisker menu appears and then the file manager appears

the desired behaviour:
- the windows key can behave as a modifier key
- if a shortcut is only all modifier keys, the action is triggered only when a key is released
- if a shortcut is a combination of modifier and normal keys, the action is triggered
  only when a normal key is released

so if the whisker menu is assigned the windows key, only when the windows key is released,
the whisker menu is activated
